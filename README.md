# Calander-website
A website that uses imessage to log dates and events.

It uses a sqllite database for event storage, python to listen for new messages and to parse the emails, and javascript, php, css, and html to do everything else.
This app is of my own design and a rougher version is being uploaded for the sake of job applications. It will probably need some setting configuration for specific users but once thats done you can create your own python functions to be executed from imessage or email.
